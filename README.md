# PianoEffecs

This is a project for CSE 471. The musical selection to be played by the Piano synthesizer is Patience by the Lumineers. Score files have the name of the instrument for each instrument, and notes for each instrument with information about the note and frequency. The effects used are reverb and flanging. Score files are found in this repository.
